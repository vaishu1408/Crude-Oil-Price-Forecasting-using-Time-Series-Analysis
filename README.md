#Crude Oil Price Prediction
Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast crude oil prices across different countries using historical production data and market indicators. The goal is to provide accurate forecasts that help investors, policymakers, and analysts make data-driven decisions in the highly volatile oil market.

Crude oil is one of the most influential commodities driving global economic activity. Its price fluctuations impact inflation, investment, and international trade. By applying time series forecasting techniques and machine learning models, this project aims to uncover underlying patterns and enhance the accuracy of price predictions.
